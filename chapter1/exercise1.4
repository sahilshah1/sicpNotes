Exercise 1.4.  Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

If b is greater than 0, then add b to a. If b is less than 0, then subtract b from a. 
This effectively means a + |b|, as the name of the function implies.
